# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject
# to change depending on the environment.

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
terraform/override.tf

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
# !example_override.tf
